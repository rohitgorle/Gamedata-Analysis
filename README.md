Final Loyalty Point Formula
Loyalty Point = (0.01 * deposit) + (0.005 * Withdrawal amount) + (0.001 * (maximum of (#deposit - #withdrawal) or 0)) + (0.2 * Number of games played)

Part A - Calculating loyalty points

On each day, there are 2 slots for each of which the loyalty points are to be calculated:
S1 from 12am to 12pm 
S2 from 12pm to 12am

Based on the above information and the data provided make reports on thee following:

Calculate overall loyalty points earned and rank players on the basis of loyalty points in the month of October. 
In case of tie, number of games played should be taken as the next criteria for ranking.
What is the average deposit amount?
What is the average deposit amount per user in a month?


Part B - How much bonus should be allocated to leaderboard players?

After calculating the loyalty points for the whole month find out which 50 players are at the top of the leaderboard. The company has allocated a pool of Rs 50000 to be given away as bonus money to the loyal players.

Now the company needs to determine how much bonus money should be given to the players.

Should they base it on the amount of loyalty points? Should it be based on number of games? Or something else?

Thatâ€™s for you to figure out.

Suggest a suitable way to divide the allocated money keeping in mind the following points:
1. Only top 50 ranked players are awarded bonus



Part C

Would you say the loyalty point formula is fair or unfair?

Can you suggest any way to make the loyalty point formula more robust?
